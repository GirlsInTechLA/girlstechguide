# youthtechguide

General tech/STEM/STEAM resources for Kids and Youth from K-12 (or for parents interested in encouraging their children to get interested in tech!)

Originally this started out as a guide for girls tech programs, but has since been expanded to include resources for all youth.

This was a dormant project for some time, and is very much a rough draft/in-progress work. However I have recently revived efforts around this and am working to add more comprehensive information in the coming months.
