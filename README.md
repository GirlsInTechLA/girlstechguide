# girlstechguide

General tech/STEM/STEAM resources for Girls from K-12 (or for parents interested in encouraging their daughters to get interested in tech!) 

For now, see [wiki](https://github.com/murriel/girlstechguide/wiki) for a content dump - to be cleaned up and set up as a github.io site at some point.
